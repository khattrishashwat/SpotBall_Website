                India defeated England by seven wickets in the first T20
                International at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on January 22, 2025.
                England, opting to bat first, managed 132 runs in 20 overs, with
                Captain Jos Buttler contributing a resilient 68 off 44 balls.
                However, the rest of the lineup faltered against India's sharp
                bowling, led by Varun Chakravarthy, who claimed 3 for 23, while
                Arshdeep Singh and Axar Patel took two wickets each. India
                chased the target in just 12.5 overs, powered by Abhishek
                Sharma’s explosive 79 off 34 balls. Among England’s bowlers,
                only Jofra Archer offered some resistance, taking 2 for 21.

                It's been a couple of years since England has shown much in
                limited-overs. Finishing in the seventh position and early
                elimination from the 2023 ODI World Cup was followed by the
                dismay of losing the semifinal to India in the 2024 T20 World
                Cup. In the wake of these significant defeats, England is now
                looking ahead to revive the game with a fresh squad to play the
                T20 and ODI series in India, dropping experienced players like
                Jonny Bairstow, Moeen Ali, Reece Topley, Sam Curran, and Chris
                Jordan.
              </p>
              <p>
                The team has arrived with a few more changes — Brendon McCullum
                takes over as all-formats head coach, and Jos Buttler moves to
                the middle order. England will play against India in a
                five-match T20 series, which will also be their only preparation
                in this region ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup set to be hosted
                by India along with Sri Lanka. The T20 series will be followed
                by a three-match ODI series to help them gear up for the
                Champions Trophy next month.

                Skipper Buttler, on the other hand, isn’t looking too far ahead,
                emphasizing that the series will focus on developing bonds
                inside their group. "Clearly, the goal is to strengthen the
                coach-captain relationship. Obviously, it's not a fresh setup
                because Baz [McCullum] has been there for a while, and there are
                a lot of players in this group who have been with him in the
                Test set-up for many years. So, sure, I'm looking forward to
                boosting that relationship in the white-ball setup. It's going
                to be a fantastic series against a strong team in their own
                environment.
              </p>
              <p>
                "We haven't talked much about the Champions Trophy or the 2026
                T20 World Cup yet. We are solely present in the moment. It's a
                very exciting tour to India, with what I'd call a full lineup
                for us. Sometimes there is so much cricket that some players
                must be rested, but that is not the case with us in this series.
                So we have a full roster of guys, which is quite exciting.
                Obviously, Baz is new to the white-ball setup, so there's a lot
                to look forward to," emphasized Buttler.
              </p>
              <p>
                England's current team has several power hitters and great
                batting lineup depth with the inclusion of multiple
                all-rounders. This is a crucial requirement for long-term
                success in T20 cricket since the cushion further down the order
                allows teams to go all out.
              </p>
              <p>
                "I think we're really blessed in terms of the bowlers that we
                have here on this tour, are all very, very capable batsmen,"
                said Buttler. "Look at men like Gus Atkinson, who has a Test
                100, Brydon Carse, who is a fantastic ball striker, and Adil
                Rashid, occasionally down at 11 but has many first-class 100s.
              </p>
              <p>
                "So, yes, I think we are very fortunate to have a lot of our
                bowlers who are very, very capable batters, and that gives a lot
                of depth to the 11. It gives confidence to the top-order guys
                that there's plenty to come so we can be really aggressive and
                not worry too much about our wicket because we have got guys
                behind us to do exactly the same job."
              </p>
              <p>
                With four matches remaining in the T20 series, England must
                regroup to stay competitive against a strong Indian side. This
                series provides a chance for England to rebuild their confidence
                and work toward improving their performance in shorter formats.
